# kq

I don't really know what this is or why I am making it. It's a 2D Vulkan renderer.

I played the original King's Quest and was inspired to make something. I didn't like NCurses (still the case), and OpenGL was getting a little old and fat now, I supposed: so Vulkan it was.

## To Do

* [x] Working Vulkan stuff.
* [x] Draw a quad.
	* [x] Draw a quad anywhere.
	* [x] Arbitrary number of quads drawn.
* [x] Texture the quad.
	* [x] Texture the quad with a texture array, so as to allow for more than one texture.
* [ ] Render text.
* [ ] Add a second render pass (is that the right term?) for post-processing effects.
